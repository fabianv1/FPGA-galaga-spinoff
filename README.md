# FPGA-galaga-spinoff
1st time FPGA project using a Nexys 4 DDR board and Xilinx Vivado environment to develop a simple spinoff Galaga game.

This project had a 2 week timeline after 2 weeks of getting familiar with Vivado, System Verilog, and using an FPGA in general. I used a VGA output to display the game in 1024x768 
resolution as well created many sprites to use for various game state screens.
